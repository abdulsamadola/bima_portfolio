                                <strong>AGRARIAN REVOLUTION IN FARMING AND FISHING:</strong> No nation in this world would be politically, economically and socially stable without sustainability in agricultural production to feed its own populace. The Nupes are blessed with fertile land and are widely known to be large scale farmers of rice, sugar cane, Shea nuts, etc. If elected, the senator will muster up all efforts to make the district a major distributor of the following cash crops:  
                                     <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">

                                <strong>INFRASTRUCTURE:</strong> There will be no any meaningful development in any society without good intra and interstate roads. Niger State shares boundaries with Kaduna and Federal Capital in the East and South east respectively within Lapai axis with Kwara state in thesouth within Jebba North axis and with Benin republic in the east within Mokwa and New Bussa axis. Nupe land therefore serves as a commercial link between many states of the Federation and some African countries. Intra and interstate good road network is therefore paramount for smooth business flow within and outside the country. The infrastructural focus of the administration will be:
                                        <br>

 <p>
                                <strong>SOCIAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES:</strong> Niger South Senatorial district is not only more populated than other zones of the state, but it also harbors industrious, hardworking, influential and educated people. Nupeland is blessed with natural and human resources. The administration will ensure the participation and enlightenment of everyone from the district through:
                                   <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">
                               <li>Women and youth empowerment through skill acquisition programmes, starter packs and soft loans</li>
                               <li>Giving out of scholarships to the talented children from poor family backgrounds</li>
                               <li>Prompt assistance to those affected by flood, fire and other related disasters.</li>
                               <li>Provision of social amenities like portable water supply, electricity and health care delivery.</li>

 <p>
                                <strong>ARTS AND CRAFTS:</strong> The industrial base of the Nupes was equally enormous as local industries abound in the past. Cloth weaving, glass making, brass and silver smiting were among the indigenous industries that had existed in  Bida, Kutigi, Doko, Mokwa, Enagi, Danchitagi and some other parts of Nupeland since the early 15th century. Others were canoe building by the people living along the riverine areas. Hats and mats weaving commonly found at Kutigi, Enagi and Kudu were highly acknowledged by foreign tourists. Arts, crafts and Culture were very exciting, elevating and redolent of our trademark in the past. Those fortunes of Nupeland were life enhancing, entertaining, which defined our identities in the national and international spheres. All those wonderful fortunes of Nupe kingdom dwindled after the colonial incursion into our territory. To redeem the past glories of the land, the following will be undertaken:
                                    <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">
                               <li>Revival Mission team will be constituted to visit the centres and villages known for these ancestral occupations to educate them on the importance of the traditional crafts and empowerment will be reimbursed for them.</li>
                               <li>Necessary support will be given to the centres that are still actively involved in their traditional trades. E.g. glass making at Masag, Brass smiting at Dokodza, Silver smiting at Tswata Mukun Bida, and Mat/Hat weaving centre at Efu Ndakada Kutigi, Kudu and Enagi.</li>
                               <li>These centres will be assisted to get loans from banks at low interest rate to let them shift from local to modern method of production</li>
                               <li>Traditional institutions will be involved in awareness campaign as traditional leaders still command respect from their subjects.</li>                              
                           </ul>

                                </p>

 <p>
                                <strong>NATIONAL CONTRIBUTION:</strong> The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has vested in the National Assembly the power to make and amend laws for the security and welfare of the citizens. Therefore, Niger South Senatorial District needs a well composed, articulated, intelligent and vibrant representation at the Red chambers for effective contribution.
If given the mandate to represent the people at the Upper chamber, I shall pursue vigorously the followings:
    <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">
                                <li>Portrayal of Nupes’ good image</li>
                                <li>Human right support</li>
                                <li>Security</li>
                                <li>Corruption </li>
                           </ul>

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <strong>YOUTH AND WOMEN EMPOWERMENT:</strong> When elected into the red chambers, I will promote and support within the limit of the constitution to see the proper implementation of the following:
    <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">
                                <li>The educated women should be treated as spelt out in the constitution</li>
                                <li>Those that are unemployed should be empowered through skill acquisition schemes</li>
                                <li>The youths who are the engine room of any nation should be properly groomed not only for the future challenges, also to prevent them from falling victims of social crimes</li>
                                <li>Training of the youth for skills acquisition should be seriously pursued by the federal and state governments. </li>
                           </ul>

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <strong>PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPTION IN NATIONAL ECONOMY:</strong> Private sector is a key contributor to alleviating poverty in any nation. The immense contributions of small scale industries in terms of increased industrial output, job creation, improvement of standard of living and general economic development cannot be over emphasized. Small scale industries still form a dominant part of business enterprises particularly in developing nations, which includes Nigeria. 
For private sectors to be fully involved in the development of the nation’s economy, I shall agitate for the following:
 <br>
                                <ul class="custom-bullet-list">
                                <li>Enactment or review of the law that will lay more emphasis on private engagement on the economic development and sustainability of the nation’s economic activities.</li>
                                <li>Review of the interest rates in banks</li>
                                <li>Review of Tax Laws and regimes</li>
                                <li>Land Use Act </li>
                           </ul>

                                </p><p>
                                <strong>FORMATION OF ZONAL FORUM:</strong> Formation of zonal forum that will bring all the state and federal legislators from the zone across the state together to be able to work together and make decisions that will foster the development of the zone.
                                </p>
